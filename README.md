# RapidMQ - Simplified RabbitMQ Client Library

**RapidMQ** is a simplified RabbitMQ client library designed to help developers manage RabbitMQ interactions more easily, particularly by providing easy ways to configure channels with different attributes such as prefetch count, and other settings. 
The aim of RapidMQ is to abstract away the complexity of using RabbitMQ and let developers focus on what matters most - implementing business logic and delivering value to users.

## Key Features
- Simple interface to RabbitMQ
- Distinct handling of channels based on channel configurations
- Easy queue binding and setup
- In-built retry mechanisms for connection stability
- A design focusing on delivering messages effectively and consistently

## Status
RapidMQ is currently under active development. While we're working hard to ensure the library is robust and feature-rich, there may be some limitations or potential bugs. Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are more than welcome!
